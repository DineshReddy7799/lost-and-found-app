🔎 Lost & Found ApplicationThe Lost & Found Application is a feature-rich, community-focused tool designed to demonstrate a high-fidelity, scalable solution for item recovery within a defined area (e.g., campus or corporate complex).The project is built as a Frontend-First Prototype, showcasing fully functional user experience driven by client-side logic.✨ Key FeaturesGeospatial Search: Implements "Search Along the Route" capabilities, allowing users to find reported items within a specific geographical path or radius defined on the map.Smart Location Mapping: Integrated map functionality using Leaflet.js that allows location input via geocoding (typing an address/name) or direct map pointing, abstracting complex coordinates from the user.Intelligent Matching: Executes a client-side Smart Matching Algorithm to suggest high-probability connections between reported Lost and Found items based on proximity and keywords.Comprehensive Listing: Visual browsing, powerful search, and category/type filtering for all active reports.Mock Communication: Simulates secure, in-app messaging between reporters and finders.Modern UX: Clean, responsive interface built based on a professional Figma design.💻 Technical Stack & ArchitectureCategoryTechnologyPurposeBackend ServingDjango (Python)Used as a lightweight, efficient templating and static file server for rapid prototyping.Frontend LogicVanilla JavaScriptHandles all core business logic, dynamic UI rendering, search, and application logic.GeospatialLeaflet.jsInteractive map rendering library and client-side geospatial calculations.Geocoding APIOpenStreetMap NominatimConverts typed location names (addresses) into map coordinates (Lat/Lon).StylingHTML5 / CSS3 (Bootstrap 5)Provides responsive design and modern components.Architectural NoteThis project follows a Frontend-First/Decoupled Architecture. Core business logic and state are currently managed by client-side JavaScript. The application is architecturally prepared for seamless integration with Supabase (Postgres, Real-time APIs, Auth, Storage) for deployment into a real-time production environment.⚙️ Setup and InstallationFollow these steps to run the application locally.1.
